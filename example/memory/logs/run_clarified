Contains methods for starting a new game, making a move, checking for a winner, and resetting the game.\n2. `Player`: Represents a player in the game. Contains a name and a symbol (either \"X\" or \"O\").\n3. `Board`: Represents the game board. Contains methods for displaying the board and updating it with new moves.\n4. `GUI`: Represents the graphical user interface for the game. Contains methods for displaying the game board, getting user input, and updating the board with new moves.\n\n### Functions\n\n1. `main`: The entry point for the application. Initializes the game and GUI objects, and starts the game loop.\n\n### Methods\n\n1. `Game.start`: Starts a new game by initializing the players and board.\n2. `Game.make_move`: Makes a move on the board for the current player.\n3. `Game.check_winner`: Checks if there is a winner on the board.\n4. `Game.reset`: Resets the game by clearing the board and starting a new game.\n5. `Player.__init__`: Initializes a new player with a name and symbol.\n6. `Board.__init__`: Initializes a new board with an empty grid.\n7. `Board.display`: Displays the current state of the board.\n8. `Board.update`: Updates the board with a new move.\n9. `GUI.__init__`: Initializes the GUI window and widgets.\n10. `GUI.display_board`: Displays the current state of the board in the GUI.\n11. `GUI.get_input`: Gets user input from the GUI.\n12. `GUI.update_board`: Updates the board with a new move in the GUI.\n\n## File Content\n\n1. main.py\n```python\nfrom game import Game\nfrom gui import GUI\n\ndef main():\n
