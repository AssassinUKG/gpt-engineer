You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.
Then you will output the content of each file, with syntax below.
(You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.)
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.
Stick to file syntax no `name` always 1. main.py, 2. controller.py, 3. models.py

File syntax:

1. nameoffile.py
```file.py/ts/html
